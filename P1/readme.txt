There are two folders here. 

The decrypotion_prep is the service setup for future project with the group. This has the code to decrypt a message encoded into a jpeg file. The encryption process hs to be conversion of text to ASCII values and each ASCII value to be converted to binary values which are added on the image. 
The update process goes from r -> g -> b. Meaning it updates first row first column first, going down the color layers. 

The Prev_fib is the code for the service i intend for this submission. It uses PHP to take a number from the user which returns the nth fibonacci number (and all the numbers leading up to the given index). 

The out.tar file that i updates has a docker instance which has the fibonacci service running.
(need to run the "startme.sh" file in the docker instace as shown in given video).
