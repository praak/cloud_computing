==============

For the Cloud Computing class. All projects and work done. 

This website basically uses three files

index.php
fibonacci.php
fibonacci.css

It takes a user input to find the 'nth' fibonacci number.
The css is only as a design file for the index.php.
Essentially thats all it does. Not sure if we needed to make it user friendly or not, so i didnt.
